/** The ServiceWorkerGlobalScope interface of the ServiceWorker API represents the global execution context of a service
  * worker.
  *
  * Developers should keep in mind that the ServiceWorker.state is not persisted across the termination/restart cycle,
  * so each event handler should assume it's being invoked with a bare, default global state.
  *
  * Once successfully registered, a service worker can and will be terminated when idle to conserve memory and processor
  * power. An active service worker is automatically restarted to respond to events, such as
  * ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.onfetch or ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.onmessage.
  *
  * Additionally, synchronous requests are not allowed from within a service worker — only asynchronous requests, like
  * those initiated via the fetch() method, can be used.
