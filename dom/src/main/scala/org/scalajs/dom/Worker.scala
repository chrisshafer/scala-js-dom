  * Of note is the fact that workers may in turn spawn new workers as long as those workers are hosted within the same
  * origin as the parent page. In addition, workers may use XMLHttpRequest for network I/O, with the exception that the
  * responseXML and channel attributes on XMLHttpRequest always return null.
